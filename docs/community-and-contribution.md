## Contribute
Our team works closely with collaborators and staff scientists at the NIH to develop Pipeliner. We understand that to deliver the best pipelines, we must get the community involved. We would love to hear your feedback and your ideas. 

Our pipelines are built upon layers of open-source tools and other community-driven projects. We are constantly testing and benchmarking new tools. If you would like to [collaborate](https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner/wiki/Contact-us#contribute) with us, please reach out to our team. Let's build together!
