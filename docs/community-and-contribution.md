## Contribute
Our team works closely with collaborators and staff scientists at the NIH to develop Pipeliner. We understand that to deliver the best pipelines, we must get the community involved. We would love to hear your feedback and your ideas. 

Our pipelines are built upon layers of open-source tools and other community-driven projects. We are constantly testing and benchmarking new tools. If you would like to collaborate with us, please reach out to our team and checkout our roadmap. Let's build together!

## Roadmap
As an open-source project, transparency is very important to our team. That is why we try to share as much information as possible regarding current and future development. Please checkout [Github Projects](https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner/projects) for insights into our development roadmap. If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to [email](mailto:CCBR_Pipeliner@mail.nih.gov) us. We welcome new contributions!
