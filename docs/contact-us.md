# Contact Us

Pipeliner is maintained by the development teams at [CCBR](https://ccbr.ccr.cancer.gov/) and [NCBR](https://ncbr.ncifcrf.gov/) and is improved by feedback from external collaborators like you. 

We want to make it easy for users to connect with us to share ideas, solve problems, and to continuously deliver the best pipelines. Here are the best ways to get in contact with us.

## General questions
For all general support requests and questions, please email us at `CCBR_Pipeliner@mail.nih.gov`. Please do not log an issue on Github for a general question or support.

## Feature requests and issues
Please create a [new issue](https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner/issues) on GitHub if you have a feature request, or if you are observing unexpected behavior.

## Roadmap
As an open-source project, transparency is very important to our team. That is why we try to share as much information as possible regarding current and future development. Please checkout [Github Projects](https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner/projects) for insights into our development roadmap.
